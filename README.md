# Hi, I'm Lucas Chaufournier

## What kind of work have you done?
I've traveled up and down the stack from low level OS and Networking code all the way up to fancy UI's in the browser. Once upon a time I was a networking researcher studying edge computing and multipath networking but these days I mostly write backend code and would describe myself as a sort of "Software Handyman". Give me an interesting problem and I'll get you a working solution in no time. I love to solve problems in distributed systems, security and networking. 

## Where do you work? 
I formerly worked at Capital One as a Senior Software Developer working in Identity and Access Management. We worked on lots of interesting problems in the secrets management space. I currently work at Square as an engineer on the Payments Data Aggregation Team. 

## What kind of problems are you interested in?
When I'm not solving interesting problems at work in the payments space, I'm hard at work exploring how technology can change the fitness landscape and how we can make fitness more accessible to everyone. 

## What do you do for fun? 
Since I work in computing, I like to escape from the keyboard as much as possible. I'm either hiking, biking, or paddling the nearest waterway. 

## What's with your Github username?
According to French Wikipedia, "The chaufournier is, in the production of quicklime , the worker driver of the lime kiln." In essence, its a lime burner.
