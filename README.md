### Hi, I'm Lucas Chaufournier

I've traveled up and down the stack from low level OS and Networking code all the way up to fancy UI's in the browser. Once upon a time I was a networking researcher studying edge computing and multipath networking but these days I mostly write backend code and would describe myself as a sort of "Software Handyman". Give me an interesting problem and I'll get you a working solution in no time. I love to solve problems in distributed systems, security and networking. When I'm not in front of the computer I'm either hiking, biking, or paddling the nearest waterway. 

I currently work at Capital One as a Senior Software Developer working in Identity and Access Management. We work on lots of interesting problems so consider joining us.
